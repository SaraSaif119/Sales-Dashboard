worked on the Superstore Dataset and Analysis using Excel, and the steps were as follows:

▪️Data Preparation:
- Set the Data Types for all columns (Dates, Numbers, Text).
- Checked for Nulls and Duplicates.

▪️Pivot Tables:
Created basic PivotTables to extract the most important KPIs:
- Total Revenue 
- Number of Orders 
- Sales by Region, Segment, Category 
- Monthly Sales Trends 
- Top 10 Cities by Sales 
- YOY, MOM Change

▪️ Dashboard:
- Designed an interactive Dashboard using PivotCharts + Slicers.

- This dashboard answers a number of key questions: 
1- What is the total revenue? → KPI Card (Total Revenue) 
2- What is the total number of orders? → KPI Card (Number of Orders) 
3- How do revenues change monthly? → Line Chart (Monthly Trends) 
4- Which states achieve the highest and lowest sales? → Map (States Sales) 5- What are the top 10 cities in sales? → Bar Chart (Top 10 Cities Sales) 
6- How are orders distributed across each product category? → Pie Chart (Orders by Category) 
7- How are sales divided among Customer Segments? → Donut Chart (Sales by Segment)
